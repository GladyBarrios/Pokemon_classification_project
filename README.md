My Goal is to use Classification models to determine a new pokemon's status.

In this project I will explore the diffrent variables that lead to a pokemons status. I will analize the data from current pokemon to determine the best classification model to predict a pokemons status. I will do this by going through the data science pipeline by using data aquisition, data exploration, statistical models and ML classification models and end it off buy reviewing my conclusions, findings, and recomendations.

As people discover new pokemon

### Stats Test 1: ANOVA Test: One Way

Analysis of variance, or ANOVA, is a statistical method that separates observed variance data into different components to use for additional tests. 

A one-way ANOVA is used for three or more groups of data, to gain information about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables: in this case our clusters vs. the log_error, respectively.

To run the ANOVA test in Python use the following import: \
<span style="color:green">from</span> scipy.stats <span style="color:green">import</span> f_oneway

- f_oneway, in this case, takes in the individual clusters and returns the f-statistic, f, and the p_value, p:
    - the f-statistic is simply a ratio of two variances. 
    - The p_vlaue is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Results:


#### Summary:


### Stats Test 2: T-Test: One Sample, Two Tailed
- A T-test allows me to compare a categorical and a continuous variable by comparing the mean of the continuous variable by subgroups based on the categorical variable
- The t-test returns the t-statistic and the p-value:
    - t-statistic: 
        - Is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error. It is used in hypothesis testing via Student's t-test. 
        - It is used in a t-test to determine if you should support or reject the null hypothesis
        - t-statistic of 0 = H<sub>0</sub>
    -  - the p-value:
        - The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct
- We wanted to compare the individual clusters to the total population. 
    - Cluster1 to the mean of ALL clusters
    - Cluster2 to the mean of ALL clusters, etc.

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is 
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

## Selecting the Best Model:

### Use Table below as a template for all Modeling results for easy comparison:

| Model | Validation/Out of Sample RMSE | R<sup>2</sup> Value |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| Baseline | 0.167366 | 2.2204 x 10<sup>-16</sup> |
| Linear Regression (OLS) | 0.166731 | 2.1433 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |  
| Tweedie Regressor (GLM) | 0.155186 | 9.4673 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|  
| Lasso Lars | 0.166731 | 2.2204 x 10<sup>-16</sup> |  
| Quadratic Regression | 0.027786 | 2.4659 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |
